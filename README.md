Prerequisites
Before we dive into the code, make sure you have the following:

Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.

A DeepL API key. You can get one by signing up on the DeepL API Developer Page.

Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.

Step 1: Set Up Your Node.js Project
First, create a new Node.js project and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy
mkdir deepl-translator
cd deepl-translator
npm init -y
npm install deepl-node dotenv
deepl-node: The official DeepL Node.js library.

dotenv: A package to load environment variables from a .env file.

Step 2: Store Your API Key Securely
Create a .env file in your project root directory and add your DeepL API key:

Copy
DEEPL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Make sure to add .env to your .gitignore file to avoid committing sensitive information to version control.

Step 3: Write the Translation Code
Now, let’s write the code to translate text using the DeepL API.

javascript
Copy
require("dotenv").config(); // Load environment variables
const deepl = require("deepl-node");

// Initialize the DeepL translator
const translator = new deepl.Translator(process.env.DEEPL_API_KEY);

/**
 * Translates text to the target language.
 * @param {string} text - The text to translate.
 * @param {string} targetLanguage - The target language code (e.g., "es" for Spanish).
 * @returns {Promise<string>} - The translated text.
 */
async function translateText(text, targetLanguage) {
  if (!text || typeof text !== "string") {
    throw new Error("Invalid text input. Please provide a valid string.");
  }

  if (!targetLanguage || typeof targetLanguage !== "string") {
    throw new Error("Invalid target language. Please provide a valid language code.");
  }

  try {
    const result = await translator.translateText(text, null, targetLanguage);
    return result.text;
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error translating text: ${err.message}`);
    throw err;
  }
}

// Example usage
translateText("Hello, world!", "es")
  .then((translatedText) => {
    console.log(`Translated text: ${translatedText}`);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(`Translation failed: ${err.message}`);
  });
Step 4: Supported Languages

Step 5: Run the Code
Save the code in a file, e.g., translate.js.

Ensure your .env file contains the correct DeepL API key:

Copy
DEEPL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Run the program:

bash
Copy
node translate.js
Example Output
If you run the code, you’ll see output like this:

Copy
Translated text: ¡Hola, mundo!
